Choosing a Model
================

1. Type of model
Scenario:
A bank wants to predict whether a loan applicant will default (yes/no).
The dataset is medium-sized, tabular, and the bank must explain decisions to regulators.

Questions (give one reason for your choice):
What type of ML problem is this?
Name one suitable model.

2. Metric Selection 
Scenario:
A disease screening model is being evaluated.

Questions (Explain your choice in one sentence):
Why is accuracy alone not sufficient?
Which metric is more important, precision or recall?

3. Cross-Validation Understanding
Scenario:
You apply 5-fold cross-validation on a dataset of 1,000 samples.

Questions:
How many models are trained?
How many times is each sample used for training?
How many times is each sample used for testing?

4. Linear vs Nonlinear Choice
Scenario:
A dataset shows a clear nonlinear pattern between inputs and output.

Question:
Name two models that can handle this well.
